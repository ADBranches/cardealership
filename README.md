## Sprint 4 Image Cleanup Contract

Edwin's Sprint 4 backend task introduces a safe cleanup contract for stale car listing media.

A car listing is eligible for image cleanup only when all of the following are true:

- The listing status is `Draft` or `Deleted`.
- The listing has remained in that state for more than 30 days.
- The listing has associated image/media links.

The cleanup contract intentionally protects active inventory. Listings with statuses such as `Available`, `Sold`, `Pending`, `Approved`, `Published`, or `Active` must be skipped.

The cleanup timestamp fallback order is:

```text
deleted_at
drafted_at
updated_at
created_at
```
