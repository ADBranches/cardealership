## Sprint 4 Image Cleanup Contract

Edwin's Sprint 4 backend task introduces a safe cleanup contract for stale car listing media.

A car listing is eligible for image cleanup only when all of the following are true:

- The listing status is `Draft` or `Deleted`.
- The listing has remained in that state for more than 30 days.
- The listing has associated image/media links.

The cleanup contract intentionally protects active inventory. Listings with statuses such as `Available`, `Sold`, `Pending`, `Approved`, `Published`, or `Active` must be skipped.

The cleanup timestamp fallback order is:

```text
deleted_at
drafted_at
updated_at
created_at
```

## Sprint 4 Image Cleanup PR Readiness

Edwin's Sprint 4 backend implementation provides a safe cleanup workflow for stale car-listing media.

### Implemented Scope

- Selects car listings with `Draft` or `Deleted` status that are older than 30 days.
- Protects active statuses such as `Available`, `Sold`, `Pending`, `Approved`, `Published`, and `Active`.
- Reads associated media through the `car_images` table and `image_url` field.
- Provides a provider-safe storage adapter with `pending`, `cloudinary`, `s3`, `firebase`, `supabase`, and `local` provider options.
- Defaults all cleanup operations to dry-run mode.
- Requires explicit flags and environment configuration before storage or database cleanup can proceed.
- Rechecks listing status and timestamp eligibility inside database removal queries.
- Provides a repeatable manual cleanup script and a scheduler-ready job.
- Keeps automatic in-process scheduling disabled until deployment-owner approval.
- Returns structured, sanitized cleanup reports with run IDs and operation counts.
- Includes repeatable manual validation covering stale, recent, active, media-free, malformed-media, dry-run, and execute-mode scenarios.

### Manual Commands

```text
cd backend
npm run test:car-image-cleanup
npm run cleanup:car-images
npm run cleanup:car-images:job
```

The execute command exists but must not be used until storage-provider behavior, production credentials, and destructive-cleanup ownership are approved:

```text
cd backend
npm run cleanup:car-images:execute
```

### Safe Defaults

```text
STORAGE_PROVIDER=pending
CLEANUP_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED=false
CLEANUP_CRON_ENABLED=false
CLEANUP_DRY_RUN=true
CLEANUP_OLDER_THAN_DAYS=30
CLEANUP_STATUSES=Draft,Deleted
```

### Provider-Dependent Work

Real storage deletion remains intentionally disabled. Before enabling destructive cleanup, the team must confirm the production storage provider, object identifier strategy, bucket or folder rules, credentials management, storage-versus-database deletion policy, scheduler ownership, cron schedule, production dry-run policy, and approval owner.
